# Python Learning Repo

This repo is just my practice while learning Python and DSA.  
I started it to track my progress and upload small projects or notes.

## Current Topics
- Basics of Python
- Loops and Functions
- Starting with DSA (arrays, stacks, queues)

## Progress
- Day 1: Setup repo and wrote first "hello world"  
- Day 2: Learned about lists and dictionaries  
- Day 3: Started functions
